"""EC A1 template code - evolving robot morphologies with ARIEL.

WHAT THIS FILE IS
-----------------
A *demo* file for starting you out with assignment 1. 
It samples one body at random, decodes it, scores it
against a set of target bodies, and shows you the result. 

*Your Job* section at the bottom of this file summarises the programming task. Full assignment description can be found in the pdf file on Canvas.


THE ASSIGNMENT IN A NUTSHELL
------------------------------
Evolve a robot BODY that is as structurally close as possible to a whole set
of given target bodies at once.

    fitness = mean tree edit distance to every body in TARGET_DIR,
              plus one standard deviation across those per-target distances

#  2. THE GENOTYPE CONTRACT
# ============================================================================ #
#
# You may use EITHER of ARIEL's two body encodings below. You may NOT invent
# your own, and CPPN is not offered for this assignment.
# Whichever you pick, the contract is the same and it is very short:
#
#       your genotype  --(its decoder)-->  nx.DiGraph  -->  fitness
#
# That DiGraph is the phenotype, and it is all the fitness function ever sees:
#
#       nodes carry   type      : "CORE" | "BRICK" | "HINGE"
#                     rotation  : "DEG_0" | "DEG_45" | "DEG_90"
#       edges carry   face      : "FRONT" | "BACK" | "RIGHT" | "LEFT"
#                                 | "TOP" | "BOTTOM"
#
# THE TWO ENCODINGS
#
#   "nde"   NeuralDevelopmentalEncoding + HighProbabilityDecoder
#           Genotype: three fixed-length float vectors (type / connection /
#           rotation genes). An INDIRECT encoding - a small vector is expanded
#           by a fixed neural network into probability matrices, which are
#           then decoded greedily into a body.
#           -> Fixed-length real vector. Standard real-valued operators work
#              out of the box. But the genotype-phenotype map is wildly
#              non-linear: a small mutation can rebuild the robot entirely.
#           -> IMPORTANT: `NeuralDevelopmentalEncoding`'s internal network is
#              randomly (re-)initialised every time you construct it, and NOT
#              derived from the genotype you pass in. If your EA's decode step
#              builds a fresh `NeuralDevelopmentalEncoding(...)` per individual
#              (the natural way to write it - see `random_nde_body` below),
#              the SAME genotype decodes to a DIFFERENT random body every call,
#              and fitness stops reflecting the genotype at all. Construct it
#              ONCE for your whole run and reuse that one instance's
#              `.forward()` for every genotype you decode.
#           -> ALSO IMPORTANT: `NeuralDevelopmentalEncoding` is a
#              `torch.nn.Module`. Its weight initialisation uses torch's own
#              RNG, entirely separate from numpy/random. `np.random.seed(...)`
#              and `random.seed(...)` do NOT control it - you also need
#              `torch.manual_seed(...)`, or your results will not reproduce
#              across separate runs even with "the same" seed.
#
#   "tree"  TreeGenome + its operators
#           Genotype: the tree itself, nodes and edges.
#           A DIRECT encoding - genotype and phenotype are the same shape.
#           -> ariel.ec.genotypes.tree.operators already gives you
#              random_tree, add_node, remove_subtree, subtree_swap,
#              crossover_subtree, mutate_hoist, mutate_shrink,
#              mutate_replace_node, mutate_subtree_replacement.
#              Variable-length genotype, so watch for bloat.
#
#
# Below, each encoding gets ONE random genotype, decoded to a graph. That is
# your starting point, not your solution: your EA has to search this space,
# not sample it once.

# zero here and you will not reach it. Work out roughly where it is: a body
# cannot be closer to a set than the set is to itself.

# Read that file - you cannot reason about your EA's behaviour without knowing what it is climbing.

        in fitness, but the latter is penalized a bit more.

#  YOUR JOB
# ============================================================================ #
#
# Everything above samples ONE body at random and scores it. Your task is to
# replace "random" with "evolved".
#
# Build a proper EA on top of `ariel.ec`. You are expected to use that module -
# it gives you the population/individual data model, the operators, and free
# persistence of every generation to a SQLite database, which you will want
# when it is time to plot convergence curves for the report.
#
#     from ariel.ec import EA, EAOperation, Individual, Population
#
# For a complete, runnable example of how those pieces fit together (a one-max
# EA with parent selection, crossover, mutation and survivor selection written
# as separate steps), read:
#
#     examples/new_EC_engine_example.py
#
# For morphology-specific evolution with the tree encoding, read:
#
#     examples/c_genotypes/1_body_evolution_tree.py
#
# and the API documentation at:
#
#     https://ci-group.github.io/ariel/
#
# ---- GENOTYPE - DEPENDENT "GOTCHA"S -------------------------
#
#   TREE: VARIABLE LENGTH - Tree genotypes grow; without pressure against it they
#     will grow forever, and every extra module costs an edit.
#   NDE: REPRODUCIBILITY   If you're using "nde": construct
#     `NeuralDevelopmentalEncoding` ONCE for your whole run, never per
#     individual or per generation, AND call `torch.manual_seed(...)` in
#     addition to the numpy/random seeds. See the two "IMPORTANT" notes under
#     "nde" in THE GENOTYPE CONTRACT above - getting either wrong means your
#     your runs won't reproduce cleanly.
#
# ---- EXPERIMENTAL RIGOUR ---------------------------------------------------
#
#   One run proves nothing - repeat every configuration over several
#     independent seeds and report mean and spread.
#   Log best/mean/worst fitness per generation. The database `ariel.ec`
#     writes makes this straightforward.
#   Compare against a baseline, a good standard is at least a random search.
#   Keep the encoding, module budget and target set identical across
#     everything you compare, change one thing at a time.
